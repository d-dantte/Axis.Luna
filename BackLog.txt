 2017/06/01 #5 =========================================================================================================

 -	Add SetPropertyValue to TypeExtensions 
	[Done]

 -	Make IOperation into an awaitable type 
	[Next Version]

 -	Make Operation functions debugger hidden 
	[Next Version]

 -	Add a fold-continuation for operations that takes an enumeration of operations and continues when ALL completes. 
	[Done]

 -	LazyOp should have special recognition for functions that return "Lazy<>" types. 
	[Done]

 -  ResolvedOps should have special recognition for functions that return Operations - it should return the inner operation. 
	[Next Version]

 -	AsyncOps should have special recognition for functions that return tasks. 
    [Done]

 -	Remove CommonDataTypes.BinaryData; the JsonObject is sufficient to encode it 
	[Done]

 -	add dispaly logic for CommonDataTypes.EncodedBinaryData, CommonDataTypes.Tags 
	[Done]

-	Add DynamicDelegateInvoker that relies on Expression tree building and compiling to create delegates that call the targeted method.
	[Done]

 -	add an extension to conveniently call any funtion on an object when the static type isn't known.
    e.g object o = ...
	o.call(methodName, methodArgs);
	The signature for the above could be something like:
	
	public static object Call(this MethodInfo method, params object[] methodArgs);
	public static object Call(this object instance, MethodInfo method, params object[] methodArgs);
	[Done]

-	Move the Call functions to the Axis.Rhea project
	[Done]

-	add ImplementsGenericInterface(Type interfaceType), used like so:
	typeof(HashSet<int>).ImplementsGenericInterface(typeof(ICollection<>)); 
	[Done]

-	Added IValidatable that has only one method public IOperation Validate(); 
	[Done]

-	Added ThrowIf(this V value, V compare, Exception ex) variant to the Exception Extensions 
	[Done]

-	Added Guid to CommonDataTypes 
	[Done]

-	Added implementation for CommonDataType.Guid to DataItem 
	[Done]

-	Added extension methods for IValidatable in Axis.Luna.Extensions.ValidatableExtensions 
	[Done]

-	Added ResolveSafely extension method for IOperations that resolves without throwing exceptions if the operation fails. Note 
	though that this method always returns void

-	Added "EnumerableExtensions.ExactlyAll", which essentially does what "Enumerable.All" does, with the exception of returning false
	if the sequence is empty.
	[Done]

-	Remove IServiceConsumer, IServiceResolver, IServiceRegistrar from this solution and created Axis.Proteus for them.
	[Done]

-	Add "EnumerableExtensions.SelectWhen", a method that does selective projections based on a predicate condition
	[Done]
